He is actively involved in teaching, research, mentoring, and academic administration at undergraduate, postgraduate, and doctoral levels. His research interests include <strong>Medical Imaging, Image Processing, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence</strong>, with a strong emphasis on developing robust and efficient computational methods for real-world intelligent systems.
</p>

 <p align="justify">
He earned his <strong>Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Roorkee</strong> under the supervision of <strong>Prof. Balasubramanian Raman</strong>, where his doctoral research focused on <strong>deep learning–based medical image computing and secure image processing</strong>. His work culminated in a successful thesis defense in <strong>June 2024</strong> and contributed novel insights to automated image analysis. He also holds an <strong>M.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Roorkee</strong>, which provided him with a strong foundation in advanced computing concepts and research methodologies. Throughout his academic career, Dr. Babu has demonstrated sustained scholarly excellence and has received several <strong>prestigious awards and merit-based scholarships</strong>, including the <strong>Prathibha Award (2006)</strong>, scholarships from the <strong>Government of Andhra Pradesh</strong>, and high rankings in competitive examinations such as <strong>EAMCET</strong> and <strong>GATE</strong>. He has also received <strong>research and travel support</strong> from organizations including the <strong>Government of India</strong>, <strong>DORA–IIT Roorkee</strong>, and <strong>Microsoft Research</strong>.
</p>

 <p align="justify">
His research contributions are reflected in a substantial body of <strong>peer-reviewed publications</strong> in reputed international journals and conferences. His work spans diverse areas such as <strong>semantic segmentation of multispectral imagery</strong>, <strong>deep learning models for medical image analysis</strong>, <strong>privacy-preserving image processing frameworks</strong>, and <strong>attention-based neural networks integrating physiological signals for personality analysis</strong>. He has published in well-known venues including <strong>IEEE ICSC</strong>, <strong>IEEE MIPR</strong>, and <strong>IJCNN</strong>, with additional accepted work in upcoming conferences such as <strong>IEEE CINS</strong>. Beyond publications, he actively serves the research community as a <strong>reviewer</strong> for several prominent conferences and journals, including <strong>CVIP</strong>, <strong>ICONIP</strong>, <strong>MIDL</strong>, <strong>Neurocomputing</strong>, and the <strong>Journal of Real-Time Image Processing</strong>, reflecting his commitment to maintaining high standards of scientific rigor and research quality.
</p>

 <p align="justify">
Dr. Babu also brings <strong>extensive teaching experience</strong>, having taught a wide range of courses such as <strong>Database Management Systems</strong>, <strong>Machine Learning</strong>, <strong>Natural Language Processing</strong>, <strong>Digital Logic Design</strong>, <strong>Advanced Database Systems</strong>, and core programming subjects in <strong>C</strong>, <strong>C++</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, and <strong>Python</strong>, along with topics in <strong>operating systems</strong> and <strong>web technologies</strong>. His teaching philosophy emphasizes clarity, accessibility, and critical thinking, aiming to bridge theoretical concepts with practical understanding. He has <strong>mentored and supervised numerous B.Tech., M.Tech., and Ph.D. students</strong>, guiding them through academic projects and research while fostering innovation, ethical research practices, and independent problem-solving skills.
</p>

 <p align="justify">
In addition to his academic and research roles, Dr. Babu contributes significantly to <strong>institutional service and academic leadership</strong> at IIIT Ranchi. He has served in various capacities, including <strong>Warden</strong>, <strong>Member of the Examination Committee</strong>, <strong>Faculty-in-Charge for Student Mentorship and Wellness</strong>, and as a member of <strong>discipline and anti-ragging committees</strong>, demonstrating his commitment to building a safe, inclusive, and supportive academic environment. He is also actively engaged in <strong>invited talks, webinars, workshops, and conferences</strong> at national and international levels on contemporary topics such as <strong>digital fraud prevention</strong>, <strong>explainable AI</strong>, and <strong>transparent statistical modeling</strong>, and continues to pursue impactful research that bridges theory and practice for broader societal benefit.
